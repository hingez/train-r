# Cycling Training Framework for Amateur Gravel Racers

**A coach's handbook for athletes targeting 120km gravel events with 8-10 weekly training hours**

This framework provides evidence-based training prescriptions for good amateur cyclists in hilly terrain who have completed 10,000+ kilometers in their base year. The methodology draws from Joe Friel's periodization principles, Coggan/Allen's power-based training, and current gravel-specific research. Every element scales to individual FTP levels and works backwards from any target race date.

## How to use this framework with different athletes

The foundation of this handbook rests on one principle: **train at percentages of FTP, not absolute watts**. An athlete with 250W FTP performs the same relative workout as someone with 350W FTP when both target 90% of threshold. This makes every prescription immediately applicable regardless of starting fitness.

Before beginning any training block, establish each athlete's current FTP through a 20-minute test (multiply result by **0.95**) or a ramp test. Retest every 4-6 weeks to recalibrate training zones. For athletes at this level—10,000+ km annual volume—expect starting CTL (Chronic Training Load) between **50-65 TSS/day**, representing solid aerobic foundations ready for structured development.

To calculate any athlete's training zones, use Coggan's 7-zone model based on their current FTP:

| Zone | % of FTP | Application |
|------|----------|-------------|
| Recovery (Z1) | <55% | Active recovery rides |
| Endurance (Z2) | 56-75% | Long aerobic rides |
| Tempo (Z3) | 76-90% | Sustained moderate efforts |
| **Sweet Spot** | 88-94% | Time-efficient FTP development |
| Threshold (Z4) | 91-105% | Direct FTP improvement |
| VO2max (Z5) | 106-120% | Aerobic ceiling expansion |
| Anaerobic (Z6) | 121-150% | Short power, race accelerations |

---

## Part 1: Periodization structure

### Building backwards from race day

Every training plan begins at the finish line and works backwards. Mark the A-race date on a calendar, then count backwards to structure the season. This approach ensures peak fitness arrives precisely when needed rather than too early or too late.

**Standard 24-week season structure:**

| Weeks Before Race | Phase | Primary Focus |
|-------------------|-------|---------------|
| 24-22 | Transition | Active recovery, cross-training |
| 21-18 | Base 1 | Aerobic endurance foundation |
| 17-14 | Base 2 | Endurance + tempo development |
| 13-10 | Base 3 | Muscular endurance, sustained power |
| 9-6 | Build 1 | Race-specific interval work |
| 5-3 | Build 2 | High-intensity sharpening |
| 2-1 | Peak | Reduced volume, maintained intensity |
| Race Week | Taper/Race | Final preparation and competition |

For athletes with less lead time, use the **abbreviated 12-16 week structure**: 6-8 weeks base building, 4 weeks race-specific build, 2 weeks peak/taper. This compressed approach sacrifices some aerobic development but remains effective for already-fit athletes.

### Phase-by-phase breakdown

**Base Phase (8-12 weeks total)** establishes the aerobic engine that powers everything else. Training distribution follows the **80/20 principle**: approximately 80% of volume at Zone 1-2 intensity, 20% at Zone 3 tempo. The goal is maximizing aerobic capacity, capillary density, and fat oxidation without accumulating excessive fatigue. Long rides progressively build toward **70-80% of target race duration** by the end of this phase.

Key adaptations during base: increased mitochondrial density, enhanced fat-burning capacity, cardiovascular efficiency improvements, and muscular endurance development through sustained lower-intensity work.

**Build Phase (6-8 weeks)** shifts toward race-specific intensities. The 80/20 distribution changes to approximately **70% Zone 1-2, 15-20% Zone 4 threshold, 5-10% Zone 5 VO2max**. Volume decreases slightly while intensity increases. This phase develops the ability to sustain race-pace power and respond to terrain changes.

**Peak Phase (3-4 weeks)** maintains intensity while dropping volume significantly. Athletes complete race simulations, practice nutrition strategies, and fine-tune pacing. The final 7-10 days constitute the taper, reducing volume by **40-50%** while keeping 1-2 short intensity sessions to maintain neuromuscular sharpness.

### Progression between training blocks

The transition from one phase to the next follows specific principles. Moving from **Base to Build**, increase workout intensity while slightly reducing total volume—the body cannot adapt to simultaneous increases in both. During Base Phase, add **10-15% weekly volume** over 3-week progressions before recovery weeks. When transitioning to Build, maintain or slightly reduce volume while introducing threshold and VO2max intervals.

Moving from **Build to Peak**, volume drops **20-30%** while intensity remains high or increases slightly. The goal shifts from building fitness to revealing it—removing accumulated fatigue while maintaining the physiological adaptations earned during Build.

Recovery week frequency depends on athlete experience and age: every **3-4 weeks** for most athletes, every **2-3 weeks** for masters athletes (40+) or those showing elevated fatigue markers. During recovery weeks, reduce volume and TSS by **50-60%** of the prior 3-week average. Maintain one short intensity session (20-30 minutes total work) to preserve neuromuscular adaptations.

---

## Part 2: Weekly training structure

### Distributing training across the week

For athletes with 8-10 hours weekly, the optimal structure balances recovery needs with training stimulus. The cardinal rule: **never schedule back-to-back high-intensity days**. Hard efforts require 36-48 hours recovery before the next quality session.

**Standard 5-day training week template:**

| Day | Session Type | Typical Duration |
|-----|--------------|------------------|
| Monday | Rest (complete) | — |
| Tuesday | Intervals (hard) | 60-90 minutes |
| Wednesday | Endurance (easy) | 60-90 minutes |
| Thursday | Intervals (hard) | 60-90 minutes |
| Friday | Rest or easy spin | 0-45 minutes |
| Saturday | Long ride | 2.5-4 hours |
| Sunday | Moderate endurance | 1.5-2.5 hours |

This framework adapts to individual schedules. Some athletes prefer compressing training into fewer days with complete rest between. The principle remains constant: separate intensity days with recovery.

### Phase-specific weekly structures

**Base Phase weekly structure** prioritizes volume over intensity. A typical week includes:
- **2 Zone 2 endurance sessions** (60-90 minutes each)
- **1-2 tempo or sweet spot sessions** (introducing intensity gradually)
- **1 long ride** progressively building from 2 hours to 3.5-4 hours
- **1-2 complete rest days**

Example Base Phase week (9 hours total):
- Tuesday: 75 min with 3×15 min tempo @ 80-85% FTP
- Wednesday: 60 min Zone 2 easy
- Thursday: 75 min with 2×20 min sweet spot @ 88-92% FTP
- Saturday: 3-hour Zone 2 endurance ride
- Sunday: 90-minute moderate endurance with terrain

**Build Phase weekly structure** adds intensity while slightly reducing volume:
- **2 structured interval sessions** (threshold, VO2max, or over-unders)
- **1 tempo/sweet spot maintenance session**
- **1 long ride** with race-simulation elements
- **1-2 recovery days**

Example Build Phase week (10 hours total):
- Tuesday: 75 min with 4×5 min @ 110% FTP (VO2max)
- Wednesday: 60 min Zone 2
- Thursday: 80 min with 3×12 min over-unders (95%/105% FTP alternating)
- Saturday: 3.5-hour simulation ride with tempo and sweet spot blocks
- Sunday: 2-hour endurance ride with climbs

**Peak Phase weekly structure** reduces volume while maintaining sharpness:
- **2 short, sharp interval sessions** (reduced sets, maintained intensity)
- **1 race simulation** (practice pacing, nutrition, equipment)
- **More recovery time** between quality sessions

### Balancing indoor and outdoor training

Northern England's climate demands strategic indoor training, particularly during winter base building. Indoor training offers **precise power control** ideal for structured intervals—sweet spot, threshold, and VO2max work translate perfectly to the turbo trainer. Outdoor training provides terrain-specific adaptation, skills development, and mental preparation for race conditions.

Indoor training generates approximately **70-100 TSS per hour** due to constant pedaling without coasting. Outdoor training typically produces **40-70 TSS per hour** depending on terrain and group dynamics. A focused 60-minute indoor session often delivers equivalent training stress to a 90-minute outdoor ride.

**Recommended balance by phase:**
- **Base Phase (winter months):** 60% indoor, 40% outdoor—prioritize indoor for consistency, outdoor for long rides when weather permits
- **Build Phase (spring):** 40% indoor, 60% outdoor—shift toward terrain-specific work
- **Peak Phase (pre-race):** 20% indoor, 80% outdoor—maximize sport-specific adaptation

---

## Part 3: Specific session types

### Sweet spot intervals (88-94% FTP)

Sweet spot training represents the **highest return on investment** for time-limited athletes. These intervals stimulate threshold adaptations while generating less fatigue than pure threshold work, allowing greater accumulated training stress.

**8-week sweet spot progression:**

| Weeks | Workout | Intensity | Recovery |
|-------|---------|-----------|----------|
| 1-2 | 3×10 min | 88-90% FTP | 5 min |
| 3-4 | 3×15 min | 89-91% FTP | 5 min |
| 5-6 | 2×20 min | 90-92% FTP | 5-10 min |
| 7-8 | 2×25 min or 3×20 min | 91-94% FTP | 8-10 min |

**Classic 2×20 Sweet Spot Session:**
- Warm-up: 15 min progressive to Zone 2
- Interval 1: 20 min @ 90% FTP, 85-95 RPM
- Recovery: 5-10 min @ 55% FTP
- Interval 2: 20 min @ 90% FTP
- Cool-down: 10 min easy spinning
- **Total session: ~75-80 minutes, ~90 TSS**

Sweet spot work belongs primarily in **Base Phase** and early Build Phase. As race-specific fitness becomes the priority, sweet spot transitions to a maintenance role (1 session weekly) while threshold and VO2max work takes prominence.

### Threshold intervals (95-105% FTP)

Threshold work directly targets FTP improvement by challenging the body's lactate clearance mechanisms. These intervals feel hard but sustainable—athletes should complete the full prescription feeling they could manage perhaps one more interval.

**Standard threshold prescriptions:**

| Format | Intensity | Recovery | When to Use |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| 2×20 min | 95-100% FTP | 5-10 min | Gold standard, Build Phase |
| 3×15 min | 95-100% FTP | 5 min | More repeatable option |
| 4×10 min | 100-105% FTP | 5 min | Higher intensity variant |
| 3×12 min | 95-100% FTP | 4 min | Intermediate progression |

**4×10 Threshold Session:**
- Warm-up: 20 min including 2×30 sec openers
- Intervals: 4×10 min @ 100% FTP
- Recovery: 5 min @ 55% FTP between intervals
- Cool-down: 10 min easy
- **Total session: ~80 minutes, ~100 TSS**

### Over-under intervals for lactate clearance

Over-under intervals train the body to clear lactate while continuing to produce power—a critical skill for gravel racing's variable terrain demands. These workouts alternate between efforts slightly above and below threshold.

**Over-Under Protocol (Build Phase):**
- Format: 3×12 min continuous
- Structure: Alternate 2 min @ 105% FTP (over) / 2 min @ 95% FTP (under)
- Recovery: 5-8 min between sets
- RPE: 7-8

**Progression options:**
- Beginner: 2×10 min, 100%/85% FTP
- Intermediate: 3×12 min (2:2 ratio), 105%/95% FTP
- Advanced: 3×15 min, 110%/90% FTP

Over-unders simulate the repeated accelerations and recoveries that characterize gravel racing. Include 1 session weekly during Build Phase.

### VO2max intervals (106-120% FTP)

VO2max work expands the aerobic ceiling—the maximum rate at which the body can utilize oxygen. These intervals feel significantly harder than threshold work and require complete recovery between efforts.

**Standard VO2max prescriptions:**

| Format | Intensity | Work:Rest | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| 5×5 min | 106-110% FTP | 1:1 | Standard intensive protocol |
| 4×8 min | 106-108% FTP | 1:0.75 | Extensive—more time at intensity |
| 3×8 min | 108-112% FTP | 1:1 | Entry point for longer intervals |

**5×5 VO2max Session:**
- Warm-up: 20 min including progressive builds
- Intervals: 5×5 min @ 108% FTP
- Recovery: 5 min @ 50-55% FTP
- Target heart rate: 90-95% max by interval end
- Cool-down: 10 min easy
- **Total session: ~75 minutes, ~100-110 TSS**

**Short-interval alternatives for variety:**

**30/30 Billat Intervals:**
- 3 sets × 10 reps
- 30 sec @ 120-130% FTP / 30 sec @ 50% FTP
- 5 min recovery between sets
- Accumulates significant VO2max time with manageable individual efforts

**40/20 Intervals:**
- 3 sets × 8 reps
- 40 sec @ 120-125% FTP / 20 sec @ 50% FTP
- 5 min recovery between sets

VO2max work enters the program during **Build Phase**, typically 1 session weekly. Placement should allow 48-72 hours recovery before next hard effort.

### Anaerobic capacity work (121-150% FTP)

Short, maximal efforts develop the anaerobic system for race starts, accelerations, and clearing technical sections. These sessions complement aerobic development without replacing it.

**Tabata Protocol (original):**
- 8×20 sec ALL OUT / 10 sec rest
- Intensity: 170%+ FTP (true maximal)
- 1-2 sets with 10 min recovery between
- Use sparingly: once every 1-2 weeks maximum

**Sprint intervals for gravel-specific power:**
- 8-12×30 sec @ 150%+ FTP / 2-3 min recovery
- Develops ability to accelerate out of corners, clear obstacles, respond to attacks

Anaerobic work plays a **supporting role** in gravel preparation. Include sparingly during Build and Peak phases—once every 7-14 days maximum.

### Gravel-specific sessions

Gravel racing demands specific adaptations beyond standard road cycling training. These specialized sessions prepare athletes for the unique challenges of 120km events on variable terrain.

**Muscle Tension Intervals (Low-Cadence Strength):**
- 5×5 min @ 88% FTP, cadence 50-55 RPM (seated)
- Recovery: 5 min normal cadence
- Develops power for loose surfaces where high-torque, low-cadence pedaling maintains traction
- Include 1 session weekly during Base and early Build Phase

**Variable Terrain Simulation:**
- 5-6×6 min @ 102-108% FTP
- 4 min recovery between intervals
- Vary cadence: some intervals at 60-70 RPM, others at 90+ RPM
- Simulates rolling gravel terrain with repeated climbs

**Gravel Race Simulation (Long Ride Structure):**
- Total duration: 3-4 hours
- Hour 1: Zone 2 base with 3×10 min tempo insertions
- Hour 2: 3×15 min sweet spot @ 88-92% FTP
- Hour 3: Zone 2 with 2×6 min VO2max efforts (simulating late-race surges)
- Hour 4: 30-45 min continuous tempo (finishing effort with fatigued legs)
- Practice race nutrition throughout

**PowerStarts (Neuromuscular Development):**
- 6-8×8-12 sec maximal accelerations from near-standstill
- 5-7 min full recovery between efforts
- Develops explosive power for accelerating on loose surfaces, clearing technical obstacles

## Part 4: TSS progression and overload

### Weekly TSS targets by training phase

Training Stress Score quantifies workout demands based on duration and intensity. For athletes with 8-10 weekly hours and solid base fitness, use these phase-specific targets:

| Phase | Weekly TSS | CTL Target | Characteristics |
|-------|------------|------------|-----------------|
| Base | 350-450 | 50-70 | Lower intensity (IF 0.55-0.65), higher volume |
| Build | 450-550 | 70-90 | Mixed intensity (IF 0.65-0.75), interval work |
| Peak | 500-600 | 80-100 | High intensity (IF 0.70-0.80), race-specific |
| Taper | 200-350 | Maintain | Reduced volume, maintained intensity |

**TSS per hour by workout type:**
- Recovery ride (Z1): 20-30 TSS
- Endurance ride (Z2): 40-55 TSS
- Tempo (Z3): 60-80 TSS
- Sweet spot session: 80-90 TSS
- Threshold intervals: 90-110 TSS
- VO2max session: 100-120 TSS

### Progressive overload principles

The body adapts through progressive overload—systematically increasing training stress while allowing recovery. CTL (fitness) should increase by **3-8 points per week** during loading phases, translating to approximately **21-56 TSS weekly increase**.

**Week-to-week progression:**
- Load for 3 weeks, recover on week 4
- Weekly TSS increase: 5-10% during loading weeks
- Monthly CTL increase: 10-15 points (sustainable long-term)
- Maximum aggressive loading: +100 TSS/week for no more than 2-3 consecutive weeks

**Example 4-week mesocycle progression:**
- Week 1: 400 TSS (baseline)
- Week 2: 440 TSS (+10%)
- Week 3: 480 TSS (+9%)
- Week 4 (recovery): 250 TSS (-48%)

### Recovery week protocols

Recovery weeks prevent overtraining while allowing accumulated adaptations to consolidate. These weeks feel counterintuitive—athletes often want to train through fatigue—but they're essential for long-term development.

**Recovery week structure:**
- Volume: 50-60% of normal training week
- TSS: 50-60% of 3-week average
- Duration: 5-7 days standard, can extend to 10 days if significantly fatigued

**Example recovery week (normal week = 10 hours, 500 TSS):**
- Monday: Complete rest
- Tuesday: 45-60 min easy Zone 1 spin
- Wednesday: Rest or optional 30 min easy
- Thursday: 60 min with 2-3×10-15 sec openers (neuromuscular maintenance)
- Friday: Rest
- Saturday: 60-90 min endurance pace
- Sunday: Optional light activity or rest
- **Total: ~5 hours, ~250 TSS**

**FTP testing opportunity:** The end of recovery weeks provides ideal conditions for fitness testing—freshened legs reveal true current capacity. Schedule 20-minute FTP tests on Saturday of recovery weeks.

### Avoiding overtraining while maximizing adaptation

Monitor these metrics to balance training stress with recovery:

**Training Stress Balance (TSB):** CTL minus ATL equals form. During hard training, TSB runs negative (-10 to -25). If TSB drops below **-30 for multiple weeks**, overtraining risk increases significantly.

**Target TSB ranges:**
- Heavy training blocks: -15 to -25
- Sustainable training: -5 to -15
- Recovery weeks: +5 to +15
- Race day: +5 to +25 (fresh and ready)

**Warning signs requiring immediate recovery:**
- Declining performance across 3+ consecutive workouts
- Elevated resting heart rate (+5 beats above normal)
- Persistent muscle soreness beyond 48 hours
- Disturbed sleep patterns
- Mood changes: irritability, depression, anxiety
- Increased perceived exertion for standard efforts

When warning signs appear, **extend recovery immediately** rather than pushing through. Overtraining recovery takes weeks to months; prevention through intelligent monitoring costs only days.

**Week 4 (Recovery):** 275-300 TSS. Maintain one short VO2max session (3×4 min).

## Conclusion

This framework provides the structure for individualized training plans while remaining adaptable to different athletes, schedules, and target events. The core principles—progressive overload, periodized intensity, adequate recovery, sport-specific preparation, and intelligent fueling—remain constant regardless of individual starting points.

Success in 120km gravel racing comes from **sustained power at tempo and sweet spot intensities**, **durability to maintain output over 4-5 hours**, and **the fueling discipline to prevent late-race collapse**. Every training prescription in this handbook develops these qualities systematically.

Adjust weekly structures to individual schedules, scale power targets to personal FTP, time weight loss appropriately, and adapt session volumes to recovery capacity. The methodology is evidence-based; the art lies in applying it to each unique athlete standing in front of you.
