2025-10-12 16:28:37 - INFO - ASSISTANT: Hello there! Welcome to Train-R, your personal cycling coach. I'm excited to help you achieve your cycling goals.

As a new client, I can assist you with a few things:

1.  **Reviewing your training history:** If you've been training already, I can analyze your past performance to understand your strengths and areas for improvement.
2.  **Creating one-off training sessions:** Need a specific workout for an indoor trainer or an outdoor ride? I can design a session tailored to your needs.
3.  **Developing longer-term training plans:** If you have a specific event or goal in mind, I can create a comprehensive plan to get you there.

What would you like to start with today?

1.  **Your current FTP (Functional Threshold Power):** This is a key metric for tailoring power-based workouts.
2.  **How long you'd like the workout to be:** Please provide the duration in minutes.
3.  **What type of workout are you looking for?** For example, are you interested in endurance, tempo, interval training (like VO2 max or threshold), or something else?

This workout will focus on building your aerobic base at a steady, comfortable pace. Let me know if you'd like any adjustments or have other training needs!
2025-10-12 16:31:19 - INFO - USER: I was thinking about doing 3 months of base training to prepare me for teh season next year. can you help to strucutre a paln for me, with workouts, duerations and ttypes
2025-10-12 16:31:22 - INFO - ASSISTANT: That's an excellent goal! A 3-month base training block is a fantastic way to build a strong foundation for next season.

Before I dive into structuring a detailed plan with specific workouts, durations, and types, it would be incredibly helpful to **analyze your recent training history**. This allows me to understand your current fitness, workload, and any areas we might need to focus on or be mindful of.

Would you like me to analyze your recent history first?

Regardless, I can certainly start outlining a general structure for a 3-month base training plan. To make sure the plan is as effective as possible, could you confirm your current **FTP** again? This will be crucial for setting appropriate training zones.
2025-10-12 16:31:54 - INFO - USER: 1
2025-10-12 16:31:56 - INFO - ASSISTANT: It looks like you might have entered "1" for your FTP. Could you please provide your actual **Functional Threshold Power (FTP)** in watts? This is a crucial number for me to design effective and personalized workouts for your base training plan.

Once I have that, I can start outlining your 3-month base training plan, including workout types, durations, and how they'll progress over time.
